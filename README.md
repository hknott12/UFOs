# UFOs
## Overview  
This project was completed to provide a resource for researching the sighting of UFOs. The website was created to provide an interesting and engaging presentation of a dataset collected about the sightings of UFOs.   

## Results
This webiste, by default, shows all UFO sightings from the dataset in a table. However, the user can filter the results in the table by typing in a filter, either by date, city, state, country, or shape of the sighting. The filters, when cleared, look like this:   
![clear_filter](readMe images/clear_filter.png)  
The user can click on any of the boxes and type in the desired date, then click anywhere else on the page to see the filtered results. For example, when the user inputs 1/13/2010, the results look like this:  
![date_filter](readMe images/date_filter.png)  
Now, the results show all of the results just from 1/13/2010. The results can be filtered the same way with any of the other boxes. Multiple filters can also be combined to get more specific results. An example is shown below.

## Summary  
One drawback of this webpage is that the dataset only covers sightings in the US from January 1 to January 13th, 2010, so it doesn't give that much data about UFO sightings in the US. A more comprehensive dataset could provide more information about UFO sightings over more time and in different areas. 

One recommendation for further development is to add a filter for duration, either for a specific number of minutes (ex, 5 minutes), or for an amount more or less than a certain number of minutes (ex, less than 5 minutes, more than 10 minutes, etc). Another recommendation is to remove the filter for country because all of the results are from the US, so the filter does not narrow down the results.
